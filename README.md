### Compression comparison

The objective is to compare the performance (compression ratio and time) of the Shannon Fano algorithm vs Huffman.

1. Design and implement a file generator bit sparce chains to define the file size (100KB, 500KB and 1000KB) and the probability distribution (equiprobable and random).
2. Design and implement algorithms to compare.
3. Generate 6 files using the generator (1 for every possible combination).
4. Apply the algorithms to the generated files
5. Analyze the results obtained considering the compression time and ratio in relation to file size and the probability distribution of symbols in the message.
